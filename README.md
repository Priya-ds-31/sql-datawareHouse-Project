# sql-datawareHouse-Project
Building a modern data warehouse with sql server , including ETL Processes, data modeling and analytics
# Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! ðŸš€

              This project showcases a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solutionâ€”ideal for portfolio presentation. It demonstrates best practices in modern data architecture, ETL development, and analytical reporting.

# Data Architecture
The project is built using the Medallion Architecture, which includes three key layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

# Bronze Layer: 
Captures raw data directly from source systems (CSV files) and stores it in a SQL Server database without transformation.

# Silver Layer: 
Performs data cleaning, standardization, and normalization to ensure the data is analysis-ready.

# Gold Layer: 
Contains curated, business-ready data organized in a star schema for optimal reporting and analytics.

# Project Overview
Key components of this project include:

Modern Data Architecture: Implementation of the Medallion Architecture for structured data layering.

# ETL Pipelines: End-to-end data ingestion and transformation from source files to the data warehouse.

# Data Modeling: Creation of star schema with well-defined fact and dimension tables for efficient querying.

# Reporting & Analytics: Development of SQL-based reports and interactive dashboards to extract insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to unify sales data from multiple sources, supporting analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

#### ðŸ“‹ Project Specifications

**Data Sources**: Load data from two distinct systemsâ€”ERP and CRMâ€”available in CSV format.
**Data Quality**: Perform data cleansing and address quality issues to ensure accuracy and consistency.
**Data Integration**: Merge data from both sources into a unified, analysis-friendly model optimized for query performance.
**Project Scope**: Focus exclusively on the most recent data; historical data tracking is out of scope.
**Documentation**: Deliver well-structured data model documentation to assist business users and analytics teams in understanding and utilizing the system effectively.
